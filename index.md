# Who am I?

I am Rolf van Kleef, a Technical Computer Science Student with a passion for
application runtimes. I am quite good at Shorttrack (Speedskating) and inline
skating, previously on an international level. In my free time, I like to
play around with Linux servers and application runtimes.

## Education and Experience

I have my VWO diploma from the "Dominicus College" in Nijmegen.
Amongst others, I follwed mathematics b, physics, biology, chemistry, and
economics.
During the last years of my tenure at this school, I and some others won a
tournament set out by [CERN](https://home.cern/)
([Beamline For Schools](https://beamlineforschools.cern/home)).
As a result of winning this tournament, we were allowed to execute an
experiment at the T-9 beamline of CERN, about which we also wrote
[a paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9120/51/6/064002/meta).

After getting my diploma, I enrolled in the University of Twente to get a
Computer Science bachelor, which I am still working on.
During my study, I was a chairman for a student-run electronics shop where
I also worked on several software projects like a point-of-sales-system.
I also worked at [Cofano B.V.](https://www.cofano.nl/) as a software developer
where I worked on several Spring Boot backends.

## Sports

## Hobby

I have worked on many side-projects, few of which I've finished.
My most notable side-projects all revolve around the development or interfacing
with application VM's.
